Agile model /Agile methodology /Agile process.
--
- It is an Iterative and Incremental Approach.
- Agile is an Iterative and Incremental Process.

Agile principles
--
1) Customer no need to wait for long time.
2) We develop, test and release piece of software to the customer with few numbers of features.
 3) We can accept/accommodate requirement changes.

**There will be good communication between Customer, Business Analyst, Developers & Testers.**

Advantages:
--
- Requirement changes are allowed in any stage of development (or) We can accommodate Requirement changes in the middle of development.
- Releases will be very fast (Weekly)
- Customer no need to wait for long time.
- Good communication between team.
- It is very easy model to adopt.

Disadvantage:
--
- Less focus on design and documentation since we deliver software very faster.

Scrum
--
- Scrum is a framework through which we build software product by following Agile Principles. Scrum includes group of people called as Scrum team. Normally contains 5-9 members.

1) Product Owner
2) Scrum Master
3) Dev Team
4) QA Team

Product Owner
--
-  Define the features of the product
-  Prioritize features according to market value
-  Adjust features and priority every iteration, as needed
-  Accept or reject work results.

Scrum Master:
--
- The main role is facilitating and driving the agile process.

Developers and QA:
--
- Develop and test the software.

Scrum Terminology
--
- **User Story:** A Feature/module in a software
- **Epic:** collection of user stories.
- **Product backlog:** Contains list of user stories. Prepared by product owner.
- **Sprint/Iteration:** Period of time to complete the user stories, decided by the product owner and team, usually 2-4 weeks of time.
- **Sprint planning meeting:** Meating conducts with the team to define what can be delivered in the sprint and duration.
- **Sprint backlog:** List of committed stories by Dev/QA for specific sprint.
- **Scrum meeting:** Meating conducted by Scrum Master everyday 15 mins. Called as scrum call/Standup meeting.
       - What did you do yesterday?
       - What will you do today?
       - Are there any impediments in your way?
 -  **Sprint retrospective meeting:** conducts meeting after completion of sprint. The entire team, including both the Scrum Master and the product owner should participate.
- **Story point:** Rough estimation of user stories, will be given by Dev & QA in the form of Fibonacci series.
`0 1 1 2 3 5 8.....`
**1 story point = 1 hour/ 1 day(6 hours)**
`Login ****> Dev-5 QA-3 = 8 Hours/ 1 Day`
- **Burndown chart:** Shows how much work remining in the sprint. Maintained by the scrum master daily.
