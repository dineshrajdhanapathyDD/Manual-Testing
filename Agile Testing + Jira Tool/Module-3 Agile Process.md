- Agile is an Iterative and Incremental Process.

Agile principles
--
1) Customer no need to wait for long time.
2) We develop, test and release piece of software to the customer with few numbers of features.
 3) We can accept/accommodate requirement changes.

**There will be good communication between Customer, Business Analyst, Developers & Testers.**

Advantages:
--
- Requirement changes are allowed in any stage of development (or) We can accommodate Requirement changes in the middle of development.
- Releases will be very fast (Weekly)
- Customer no need to wait for long time.
- Good communication between team.
- It is very easy model to adopt.

Disadvantage:
--
- Less focus on design and documentation since we deliver software very faster.
