# manual-testing

Manual testing is a process of manually testing software applications to identify any defects or issues. It involves running the software system through a series of tests using human intervention and judgment to identify any potential issues with the system.

Functionality testing is a type of testing that focuses on testing the software application's functionality or features to ensure that they are working as intended. This type of testing typically involves testing individual features or functions of the system to ensure that they meet the requirements specified in the FRS document.

Manual testing can be used for functionality testing by having a tester manually test each feature or function of the system to ensure that it is working as intended. This type of testing can be time-consuming, but it can also be very thorough and can help to identify any issues or defects that may be missed by automated testing.

In general, manual testing is useful for testing functionality because it allows testers to simulate real-world usage scenarios and identify issues that may not be detected by automated testing. However, it is also important to note that manual testing can be prone to human error and may not be as reliable as automated testing for certain types of testing, such as performance testing or load testing. As such, a combination of manual and automated testing is often used to ensure that a software application is thoroughly tested before it is released to users.

Here is a general step-by-step process for testing a web application manually:

Identify the testing scope and requirements based on the FRS document.
Set up the testing environment, including the web server and necessary software.
Identify and document the test scenarios based on the FRS document and other available resources.
Create test cases for each identified scenario, including the steps to execute and the expected results.
Execute the test cases and record the results, including any issues or defects found.
Report and track any issues or defects found using a bug tracking tool or similar system.
Retest the issues or defects once they have been resolved to ensure that they are fixed properly.
Perform regression testing to ensure that changes made to fix any issues or defects did not introduce any new issues.
Ensure that the application meets the non-functional requirements such as performance, security and usability.
Once all testing is complete, prepare a test report that documents the testing process and results.
Here are some common types of testing used in web application testing:

Functional Testing: This involves testing each function of the web application to ensure it meets the requirements specified in the FRS document.
Usability Testing: This involves testing the user interface and user experience of the web application to ensure that it is user-friendly and easy to use.
Compatibility Testing: This involves testing the web application on different browsers, operating systems, and devices to ensure that it is compatible with all intended platforms.
Performance Testing: This involves testing the performance of the web application under various conditions to ensure that it meets the non-functional requirements such as scalability, reliability and response time.
Security Testing: This involves testing the web application for security vulnerabilities and ensuring that sensitive data is properly protected.
Regression Testing: This involves retesting previously tested functionality to ensure that changes made to fix any issues or defects did not introduce any new issues.
It is important to note that the specific testing used in web application testing may vary depending on the specific requirements of the application and the testing strategy employed by the testing team.


#creating document and functionality of manual testing

FRS DOCUMENT: The Functional Requirements Specification (FRS) document outlines the functional requirements of a software system or product. It includes information on the features and functions that the system must have in order to fulfill its intended purpose.

TEST PLAN: A test plan is a document that outlines the testing strategy, objectives, scope, and approach for a software product. It includes details on the test environment, resources required, test cases, and the timeline for testing.

BUG REPORT: A bug report is a document that describes a defect or issue found during the testing process. It typically includes information on the steps to reproduce the issue, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior observed.

RTM: The Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) is a document that links the requirements listed in the FRS document to the test cases created for those requirements. It helps ensure that all requirements are covered by the testing process.

TEST SCENARIOS: Test scenarios are a set of steps or conditions that need to be followed or met in order to test a particular aspect of a software system or product. They are typically derived from the FRS document and are used to create test cases.

TEST CASES: Test cases are a set of specific instructions or actions to be taken during the testing process. They are derived from test scenarios and are designed to test a particular aspect or feature of a software system or product.

TEST EXECUTION RESULT: The test execution result is a document that records the outcomes of the testing process. It typically includes information on the test cases executed, any defects or issues found, and the overall results of the testing process.
