## Manual Software Testing Part-1

Software
--
A Software is a collection of computer programs that helps us to perform a task.
-  Types of Software:
   - System software
        Ex: Device drivers, Operating Systems, Servers, Utilities, etc.
   -  Programming software
        Ex: compilers, debuggers, interpreters, etc.
   -  Application software
     Ex: Web Applications, Mobile Apps, Desktop Applications etc.

```x Bank(company)-----=---> IT Company---> Develop--->Test--->Deliver --->XBank```

What is software Testing?
--
- Software Testing is a part of software development process.
- Software Testing is an activity to detect and identify the defects in the software.
- The objective of testing is to release quality product to the client.

Software Quality
--
- Bug-free.
- Delivered on time.
- Within budget.
- Meets requirements and/or expectations.
- Maintainable.

Project Vs Product
--
 - If software application is developed for specific customer based on the requirement then it is called Project.
 - If software application is developed for multiple customers based on market requirements, then it called Product.

Error, Bug/defect & Failure
--
- Error: any incorrect human action that produces a problem in the system is called the error.
- Bug: Deviation from the expected behavior to the actual behavior is called the bug/defect.
- Failure: the deviation identified by end- user while using the system is called a failure.

Why the software has bugs?
--
- Miscommunication or no communication
- Software complexity
- Programming errors
- Changing requirements
- Lack of skilled testers

## Manual Software Testing Part-2

SDLC- Software Development Life Cycle
--
 - Software Development Life Cycle is a process used by software industry to design, develop and test software's.
  - P - People
  - P - Process
  - P - Product


Software Development Life Cycle
- Requirements Analysis
- Design
- Development
- Testing    
- Maintenance                                      
   
### Waterfall Model
     Requirement Analysis --> System Design --> Implementation Testing -->Deployment Maintenance 
   
Advantages of Waterfall Model
--
- Quality of the product will be good.
- Since Requirement changes are not allowed, chances of finding bugs will be less.
- Initial investment is less since the testers are hired at the later stages.
 - Preferred for small projects where requirements are feezed.
 
 Disadvantages of water model
--
 - Requirement changes are not allowed.
 - If there is defect in Requirement that will be continued in later phases.
 - Total investment is more, because time taking for rework on defect is time consuming which leads to high investment.
- Testing will start only after coding.
    
### Spiral model
         Planning --> Risk Analysis --> Engineering & Execution --> Evaluation.
        Version-1 --> Requirements analysis - prototype - Development & Testing- Customer Evaluation  - one cycle completed
        new requirements 
        version -2 -->  Requirements analysis - prototype - Development & Testing- Customer Evaluation   - second cycle

- Spiral Model is iterative model.
- Spiral Model overcome drawbacks of Waterfall model.
- We follow spiral model whenever there is dependency on the modules.
- In every cycle new software will be released to customer.
- Software will be released in multiple versions. So it is also called version control model.
     
Advantages of Spiral Model
--
- Testing is done in every cycle, before going to the next cycle.
- Customer will get to use the software for every module.
- Requirement changes are allowed after every cycle before going to the next cycle.

Disadvantages of Spiral Model
--
- Requirement changes are NOT allowed in between the cycle.
- Every cycle of spiral model looks like waterfall model.
- There is no testing in requirement & design phase.
        
```Prototype--- blue print of the software.```
```initial requirements from the customer---> Prototype--> Customer--> design, coding, testing```

```Validation --> unit testing (white box testing) --> integration testing (white box testing) --> system testing (black box testing) --> UAT (black box testing)```

VERIFICATION 
--
- Verification checks whether we are building the right product.
- Focus on Documentation


Static Test Technique
--
- Testing the project related documents is called as static testing.
 - Review
 - Walkthrough
 - inspection

VALIDATION
--
- Validation checks whether we are building the product right.
- Takes place after verifications are completed.
- Focus on Software

Dyanamic Testing
--
Testing the actual software

- unit testing
- integration testing
- system testing
- UA testing

```s1--> s2---> s3.......**** Application```

Advantages :
  -  Testing is involved in each and every phase.
 
Disadvantages:
   - Documentation is more.
   - Initial investment is more.



## Manual Software Testing Part-3
                
Static testing techniques
 - Review
 - Walkthrough
 - Inspection
 
 Dynamic testing techniques
 - Unit testing
 - integration testing
 - System testing
 - UAT
 
 Review
--
 - Conducts on documents to ensure correctness and completeness.
 - Requirement Reviews
 - Design Reviews
 - Code Reviews
- Test plan reviews
- Test cases reviews etc.

Walkthrough
--
 - It is a informal review.
 - Author reads the documents or code and discuss with peers.
 - It's not pre-planned and can be done whenever required.
 - Also walkthrough does not have minutes of the meet.

Inspection
--
 - its a most formal review type.
 - In which at least 3- 8 people will sit in the meeting 1- reader 2-writer 3- moderator plus concerned.
- Inspection will have a proper schedule which will be intimated via email to the concerned developer/tester:

QA Vs QC Vs QE
--
QA 
--
 - QA is Process related.
 - QA focuses on building in quality.
 - QA is preventing defects.
 - QA is process oriented.
 - QC for testing part in SDLC

QC
--
- QC is the actual testing of the software. 
- QC focuses on testing for quality.
- QC is detecting defects.
- QC is Product oriented.
- QA for entire life cycle.

QE
--
QE --> Quality engineering

 - Software Enginner /SE
 - Quality Engineer /QE

- p - people --> QC (testers)
- Ñ€- process -->
- p- product

SDLC
--
- Requirement Analysis
- Desing
- Coding
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

Levels of testing
--
 - Unit Testing
 - Integration Testing
 - System Testing
 - User Acceptance Testing (UAT)


Unit Testing
--
- A unit is a single component or module of a software.
- Unit testing conducts on a single program or single module.
- Unit Testing is white box testing technique.
- Unit testing is conducted by the developers.

Unit testing techniques:
--
- Basis path testing
- Control structure testing
- Conditional coverage
- Loops Coverage
- Mutation Testing

examples:- 
--
```
a=20 b=10
 if a>b
  print a is largest
 else
  b is largest
 1....5 numbers
 i=1
 max=10
while(i<=max)
{
print i
            12345
i=i+1
 }
 if user='scott' and password="123"
     allow login
 else
  Not allow login
```
Integration Testing
--
 - Integration testing performed between 2 or more modules.
 - Integration testing focuses on checking data communication between multiple modules.
 - Integrated Testing is white box testing technique.

Types of integration testing
--
1) Incremental Integration Testing
2) Non- Incremental Integration Testing

Incremental Integration Testing: 
--
- Incrementally adding the modules and testing the data flow between the modules.

- 2 Approaches
  - Top Down
  - Bottom Up

- Top Down -Incremental Integration Testing:
Incrementally adding the modules and testing the data flow between 1 the modules. And ensure the module added is the child of
previous module.

- Bottom Up -Incremental Integration Testing:
Incrementally adding the modules and testing the data flow between the modules. And ensure the module added is the parent of
the previous module.

Non- Incremental Integration Testing
--
- Adding all the modules in a single shot and test the data flow between modules.
Drawbacks:
  - We might miss data flow between some of the modules.
  - If you find any defect we can't understand the root cause of defect.

System Testing
--
 - Testing over all functionality of the application with respective client requirements.
 - It is a black box testing technique.
 - This testing is conducted by testing team.
- After completion of component and integration level testing's we start System testing.
 - Before conducting system testing, we should know the customer requirements.
 - System Testing focusses on below aspects:
    - User Interface Testing (GUI)
   - Functional Testing
   - Non-Functional Testing
   - Usability Testing

 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
 --
 
- After completion of system testing UAT team conducts acceptance testing in two levels.
  - Alpha testing
  - Beta testing



## Manual Software Testing Part-4


What is GUI Testing?
--
-  Graphical User-interface Testing or GUI testing is a process of testing the user interface
  of an application.
 - A graphical user interface includes all the elements such as menus, checkbox, buttons,
  colors, fonts, sizes, icons, content, and images.
     
GUI Testing Checklist
--
  - Testing the size, position, width, height of the elements.
  - Testing of the error messages that are getting displayed.
  - Testing the different sections of the screen.
  - Testing of the font whether it is readable or not.
  - Testing of the screen in different resolutions with the help of zooming in and zooming out.
  - Testing the alignment of the texts and other elements like icons, buttons, etc. are in proper place or not.
  - Testing the colors of the fonts.
  - Testing whether the image has good clarity or not.
  - Testing the alignment of the images.
  - Testing of the spelling.
  -  The user must not get frustrated while using the system interface.
  - Testing whether the interface is attractive or not.
 - Testing of the scrollbars according to the size of the page if any.
- Testing of the disabled fields if any.
 - Testing of the size of the images.
  - Testing of the headings whether it is properly aligned or not.
 - Testing of the color of the hyperlink.
 - Testing UI Elements like button, textbox, text area, check box, radio buttons, drop downs, links etc.

Usability Testing
--
 -   During this testing validates application provided context sensitive help or not to the
  user.
  -  Checks how easily the end users are able to understand and operate the application is
  called usability testing.

  Functional Testing
--
-  Functionality is nothing but behavior of application.
-  Functional testing talks about how your feature should work.
 	- Object Properties Testing
	- Database Testing
   -  Error Handling
	- Calculations/Manipulations Testing
	- Links Existence & Links Execution
	- Cookies & Sessions

 - Object Properties Testing
	  - Check the properties of objects present on the Application.
   Ex: Enable, disable, visible, Focus......

 -  Database Testing/Backend testing:
	- Checking database operations with respect to user operations.
	 - DML Operations ( Data Manipulation Language)
		 - insert
		 - update
		 - delete
		 - select
	- Table & Column level validations(Column type, column length, number of columns...)
 Relation between the tables ( Normalization)
	- Functions
	 - Procedures
	 - Triggers
	 - Indexes
	 - Views
	 - etc......

 - Error Handling Testing
	- Tester verify the error messages while performing incorrect actions on the application.
	- Error messages should be readable.
	- User understandable/Simple language.
		- incorrect data
		- invalid data (more related)

 - Calculations/Manipulations Testing
	- Tester should verify the calculations.


 - Links Existence & Links Execution
	 - Where exactly the links are placed---- Links existence
	 - Links are navigating to proper page or not .... Links execution
		 - Internal links
		 - External links
		 - Brokens links

 - Cookies & Sessions
	 - Cookies:
		 - Temporary files created by Browser while browsing the pages through internet.
	 - Sessions:
		 - Sessions are time slots created by the server. Session will be expired after some time (If you are idle for some time)

Non-Functional Testing
--
  - Once the application functionality is stable then we do Non-Functional testing.
  - Focus on performance, load it can take and security etc.

	- Performance Testing
	     - Load Testing
	      - Stress Testing
	      - Volume Testing
	- Security Testing
	- Recovery Testing
	- Compatibility Testing
	- Configuration Testing 
	- Installation Testing
	- Sanitation/Garbage Testing
           
 - Performance Testing: speed of the application.               
	- Load: Gradually Increasing the load on the application then check the speed of the application.
	- Stress: suddenly increase/decrease the load on the application and check speed of the application.
	- Volume: Check how much data is able to handle by the application.

- Security testing: How secure our application.
   - Authentication ---> Users are valid or not
   - Authorization/Access Control ---> permissions of the valid user.

- Recovery testing:
     - check the system change to abnormal to normal.

- Compatibility testing
	- Forward Compatibility
	- Backward Compatibility
	- Hardware Compatibility (configuration testing)

- Installation testing
	- Check screens are clear to understand.
	- Screens navigation
	- Simple or not
	- Un-installation

- Sanitation/Garbage testing
	 - If any application provides extra features/functionality then we consider them as bug.

## Functional Testing vs Non-functional Testing

|Functional Testing|                     Non-Functional Testing                        |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
| Validates functionality of Software. |Verify the performance, security, reliability of the software.         |
|  Functionality describes what software does.      |Non-Functionality describes how   software works.       |
| Concentrates on user requirement.| Concentrates on user expectation.|
|Functional testing takes place before Non-functional testing.| Non-Functional testing performed after finishing Functional testing. |

## Manual Software Testing Part-5

Regression Testing
--
- Testing conducts on modified build to make sure there will not be impact on
  existing functionality because of changes like adding/deleting/modifying features.
   - Unit regression testing
   - Testing only the changes/modifications done by the developer.
   - Regional Regression Testing
   - Testing the modified module along with the impacted modules
	 - Impact Analysis meeting conducts to identify impacted modules with QA & Dev.
   - Full Regression
	 - Testing the main feature & remaining part of the application.
	 - Ex: Dev has done changes in many modules, instead of identifying impacted modules,
    we perform one round of full regression.


Re-Testing
--
-  Whenever the developer fixed a bug, tester will test the bug fix is called Re-
  testing.
- Tester close the bug if it worked otherwise re-open and send to developer.
- To ensure that the defects which were found and posted in the earlier build were
  fixed or not in the current build.
-  Example
	  - Build 1.0 was released. Test team found some defects (Defect Id 1.0.1, 1.0.2)
    and posted.
	  - Build 1.1 was released, now testing the defects 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 in this build is
    retesting.

Example: Re-Testing Vs Regression Testing
--
-  An Application Under Test has three modules namely Admin, Purchase and Finance.
                                      
- Finance module depends on Purchase module.
- If a tester found a bug on Purchase module and posted. Once the bug is fixed, the tester needs to do Retesting to verify whether the bug related to the Purchase is fixed or not and also tester needs to do Regression Testing to test the Finance module which depends on the Purchase module.
         ```Admin --> Purchase --> Finance```

Smoke Vs Sanity Testing
--
 - Smoke and Sanity Testing come into the picture after build release.

| Smoke Testing |Sanity Testing|
|---------------|--------------|
|Smoke Test is done to make sure the build we received from the development team is testable/stable or not|Sanity Test is done during the release phase to check for the main functionalities of the application without going deeper.|
|Smoke Testing is performed by both Developers and Testers|Sanity Testing is performed by Testers alone|
|Smoke Testing, build may be either stable or unstable|Sanity Testing, build is relatively stable|
|It is done on initial builds.|It is done on stable builds.|
|It is a part of basic testing.|It is a part of regression testing.|
|Usually it is done every time there is a new build release.|It is planned when there is no enough time to do in- depth testing.|

Exploratory Testing
--
   - We have to explore the application ,understand completely and test it.
    - Understand the application, identify all possible scenarios, document it then use it for
    testing.
    - We do exploratory testing when the Application ready but there is no requirement.
    - Test Engineer will do exploratory testing when there is no requirement.
    - Drawbacks:
	    - You might misunderstand any feature as a bug (or) any bug as a feature since you do not have requirement.
	    - Time consuming
	    - If there is any bug in application, you will never know about it.
 
Adhoc Testing
--
-  Testing application randomly without any test cases or any business requirement document.
 - Adhoc testing is an informal testing type with an aim to break the system.
 - Tester should have knowledge of application even thou he doesn't have requirements/test cases.
 -  This testing is usually an unplanned activity.
		- no documentation
		- no test design 
		- no test case

Monkey/Gorilla Testing
--
 - Testing application randomly without any test cases or any business requirement document.
 - Ad hoc testing is an informal testing type with an aim to break the system.
 - Tester do not have knowledge of application
 - Suitable for gaming applications.

Adhoc Testing Vs Monkey Testing Vs Exploratory Testing
--
   
   |Adhoc Testing|Monkey Testing|Exploratory Testing|
   |-------------|--------------|------------------|
   |No Documentation|No Documentation|No Documentation|
   |No Plan|No Plan|No Plan|
   |Informal testing|Informal testing|Informal testing|
   |Tester should know Application functionality|Testers doesn't know Application functionality|Testers doesn't know Application functionality|
   |Random Testing|Random Testing|Random Testing|
   |Intension is to break the application/find out corner defects|Intension is to break the application/find out corner defects|Intension is to learn or explore functionality of application|
   |Any Applications|Gaming Applications|Any Applications which is new to tester|



 Positive Testing
--
-  Testing the application with valid inputs is called as Positive Testing.
-  It checks whether an application behaves as expected with positive inputs.
    - For example -
                Enter Only Numbers
                     99999
                Positive Testing
		- There is a text box in an application which can accept only numbers. Entering values up to 99999 will be acceptable by the system and any other values apart from this should not be acceptable.
		- To do positive testing, set the valid input values from o to 99999 and check whether the system is accepting the values.
     
 Negative testing
--
-  Testing the application with invalid inputs is called as Negative Testing.
- It checks whether an application behaves as expected with the negative inputs.
   -  For example -
                 Enter Only Numbers
                     abcdef
                 Negative Testing
		- Negative testing can be performed by entering characters A to Z or from a to z.
Either software system should not accept the values or else it should throw an
error message for these invalid data inputs.


Positive V/s Negative Test Cases
--
- Requirement:
	  - For Example if a text box is listed as a feature and in FRS it is mentioned as Text box accepts
	  -  6 - 20 characters and only alphabets.
 - Positive Test Cases:
	  - Textbox accepts 6 characters.
	  - Textbox accepts upto 20 chars length.
	  - Textbox accepts any value in between 6-20 chars length.
	  - Textbox accepts all alphabets.
 - Negative Test Cases:
	  - Textbox should not accept less than 6 chars.
	  - Textbox should not accept chars more than 20 chars.
	  - Textbox should not accept special characters.
	  - Textbox should not accept numerical.

END-To-END Testing
--
-  Testing the overall functionalities of the system including the data integration
  among all the modules is called end-to-end testing.

**End-To-End Test**

   -  Login
   - ADD New Customer
   - Edit customer
   - Delete Customer
   - Logout

Globalization and Localization Testing
--
- Globalization Testing:
	- Performed to ensure the system or software application can run in any cultural or local environment.
	- Different aspects of the software application are tested to ensure that it supports every language and different attributes.
	- It tests the different currency formats, mobile number formats and address formats are supported by the application.
	- For example, Facebook.com supports many of the languages and it can be accessed by people of different countries. Hence it is a globalized product.
  
- Localization Testing:
	- Performed to check system or software application for a specific geographical and cultural environment.
	- Localized product only supports the specific kind of language and is usable only in specific region.
	- It testes the specific currency format, mobile number format and address format is working properly or not.
	- For example, Baidu.com supports only the Chinese language and can be accessed only by people of few countries. Hence it is a localized product.
